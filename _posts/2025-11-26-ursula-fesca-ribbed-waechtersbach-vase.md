Wächtersbach’s red earthenware comes from the iron-rich clay of Hessen, and the exposed foot on this vase shows the material plainly.

When Ursula Fesca joined the factory in 1931 to bring [Bauhaus clarity to its designs](https://www.steinmarks.co.uk/page?id=290), she focused on simple forms, economical glazing, and surface structures derived from fabrication rather than ornament.

This vase presents a compact rounded body with evenly moulded ribs and a quiet off-white glaze that leaves the warm clay visible at the edges.

Ursula Fesca’s Wächtersbach work fits current design trends: warm materials, quiet forms, and honest clay. This ribbed vase works well in Japandi and soft-modern interiors.
